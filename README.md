This game is called The Falling Game. You have to move the left and right arrows keys to make ball fall through the holes of the lines. The lines in the game continously move up, while you move the ball left or right to fall through the holes. If ball disappears while lines move up, the game will end. The score of how many lines you fall through will appear at end of game.
